# starfiddle
a js/donet/.. fiddle 

#Goal 
Goal of this project is to experiment with webassembly.
Idea came from the Try .net me  Microsofot -  (https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/creating-interactive-net-documentation/)[https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/creating-interactive-net-documentation/]

And I always like the always of the *fiddle, for example [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/) or [DotNetFiddle](https://dotnetfiddle.net/)

Would it be possibe to compile any Hello World to webassembly and execute this into the web browser ?

#Hello world ?
My personal usage of a fiddle is to be able to enter 10/20 lines of code to try something and share it with someone else.

Goal is not to create full editor in line.
